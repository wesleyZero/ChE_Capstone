# Capstone I 

This was the first capstone project, of a two-part series for my chemical engineering senior design class. I learned a lot on this first project and as a result, I cleaned up the code massively when doing the second project. All of the code was in a single script, as well as the the code being not very modular. Since the capstone II project has the same concepts, but with a better code base. Please look at my [Capstone II project](https://github.com/wesleyZero/capstone_II/tree/main) to evaluate my coding abilities. For this project, I would like to simply write what I learned to do better in the second project. 

## What I learned (not) to do, and do in the second project 

1. I created a huge massive script, I (once again) vastly underestimated the scope of the project (how large it was going to become) so it became a massive mess. 

2.
