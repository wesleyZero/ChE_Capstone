# Repo for my chemical engineering capstone project 

[Repo currently being worked on / in progress]

This code calculates the economics (15yr net present value) of a chemical plant
that produces 200kta of ethylene annually. 

The core of the code, is a numerical approximation to an ordinary differential equation 
to solve for the reactor effluent composition for an arbiturary sized reactor. For each given 
reactor volume, the economics are calculated. Various design parameters are economically
modeled to find the ideal Temperature, Pressure, and Steam-to-feed ratio. 

This code is written to satisfy up to level 3 of Douglass' heirarchy of chemical 
design processes
